## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
pander(favstats(((`Annual Rate USD`/12)/4)/`Standard Hours` ~ `Global Sub Function`, data = censusClass) [, c("Global Sub Function","mean","sd","n")])
```
```{r}
pander(favstats(`Years of Service` ~ Location, data = productionwork) [, c("Location","mean","sd","n")])
```
```{r}
pander(favstats(`Years of Service` ~ `Global Job Title`, data = productionwork) [, c("Global Job Title","mean","sd","n")])
```
```{r}
GJT.aov <- aov(`Years of Service` ~ `Global Job Title`, data = productionwork)
pander(summary(GJT.aov))
```
```{r}
plotly(`Years of Service` ~ `Global Job Title`, data = productionwork, main = "Global Job Title by Years of Service", ylab = "Years of Service Mean", xlab = "Global Job Title")
```





```{r}
pander(favstats(`Years of Service` ~ `Global Job Title`, data = ind1prodwork) [, c("Global Job Title","mean","sd","n")])
```
```{r}
pander(favstats(`Years of Service` ~ `Global Job Title`, data = ind2prodwork) [, c("Global Job Title","mean","sd","n")])
```
```{r}
pander(favstats(`Years of Service` ~ `Global Job Title`, data = in1prodwork) [, c("Global Job Title","mean","sd","n")])
```








## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
